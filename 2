I recently read The Timeless Way of Building by Christopher Alexander because of an anonymous Twitter recommendation. Though about physical architecture it spurred a lot of thoughts about software. Which I suppose is a kind of architecture.

# The Quality without a Name (Homeostasis)

The first part of the book concerns "The quality without a name". He gives a few different candidate words like alive, whole, comfortable, freedom, exact, egoless, eternal but to me the best word to describe the balancing of forces in a complex system is homeostasis.

We focus on progress. And what is new has more salience than what is constant. But the reality is the supermajority of people's time and energy are spent staying exactly where they are. Maintaining inner balance in their own lives and bodies and staying in harmony with the wider social context. Every hour slept, every meal eaten, every time you brush your teeth. It's all maintenance.

Seeing your bank account go up as you work feels like progress. But what is the money for? The majority goes to rent/mortgage/food, homeostasis. Savings go towards funding a retirement which is just a way to prolong homeostasis past the point where you can work. Work being just a way to serve the broader homeostasis of civilization.

The chapter introducing the quality is full of beautiful scenes of Koi ponds and bird baths. And it is beautiful to dance through life. But the last sentence "It is a slightly bitter quality" gets to the heart of it. We swim lest we drown.
