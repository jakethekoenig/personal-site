I got a half keyboard so I could type with my hands separated by 1-2 feet for ergonomics and now I feel like I'm flying a spaceship.

One issue is there seems to be some strange keyboard buffering when you use two keyboards on Ubuntu. I'm not sure what causes it or how to fix it. It correctly interweaves my keyboard presses but it only sends them to the application after I pause for a ~second.
