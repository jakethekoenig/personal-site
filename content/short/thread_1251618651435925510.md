Pretty unhappy with my play in the sealed showcase qualifier. Went 0-3 drop. Not sure why I was more interested in playing my medium RW cyclers deck instead of my broken rares.

The most representative moment of the event was in match 3 game 3 when I Mythos of Illunaed my Island with less than two minutes on the clock. I was going to deck anyway but it didn't feel great.
