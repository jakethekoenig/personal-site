For basketball 75% seems right on base right. LeBron James isn't playing but I guess it's not unusual for the best American players to not play the Olympics.

I would have thought 60% was too high but if I'm understanding Djokovic's stats wikipedia page correctly he's won 70% of the tournaments he's played. Federer and Nadal won't be playing so I'd say this should probably be 80%.
