I often struggle to suspend m my disbelief about how much trouble people in sci fi have killing each other despite their godlike technology. At least Dune has a ton of backstory about how they all agreed not to try too hard. Sort of seems realistic.

I love how there's a fancy sci fi name for the agreement not to use nukes which was made in the year 10000 or something. I'd assumed the Geneva convention did that but I guess nukes are totally legal today. Glad we get to banning their use in 8k years.
