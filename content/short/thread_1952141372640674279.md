I play rock paper scissors like melee. There are good matchups and bad matchups. But you have a main and don't switch every game. I'm a paper main

I've got the rock match up down and paper is 50-50. If I can just find some tricks in the scissors matchup I'll be unstoppable

This is actually a true fact about me. I've only thrown paper since I decided to be a paper main over a decade ago
