Lost to an interesting mill deck round 8. 5-3 Now but I guess I might as well play the last one. I think I messed up by boarding into the UB deck this time. I was also choked on mana. I wonder if the UB deck I posted up top wants another 2 lands.

And I lost the last one to a good Mardu Party deck featuring Zagras. Ah well. Think I still probably min cash with 5-4. Glad the tournament went so fast. The format was a lot of fun. Especially in the first half of the day when I was winning.
