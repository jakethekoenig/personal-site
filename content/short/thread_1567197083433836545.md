A great math problem that is just about shapes but unfortunately I don't know how to express in a way a 5 y/o would understand: Are there two subsets of the plane which are not homeomorphic but have homeomorphic extrusions.

Roughly: Are there two distinct flat shapes which become the same when fattened?

distinct/the same don't really capture (not) homeomorphic.
