@SheaStrausman It looks like 18-29 us people had a *cumulative* hospitalization rate over the pandemic of 78 per 100k: When you factor in I'm double vacced, healthy weight, no relevant conditions I'd guess my (expected) rate is less than half that.

@SheaStrausman Take into account my risk is only reduced by another fifth by the booster that reduces my chance of hospitalization by something like 1/10k.
