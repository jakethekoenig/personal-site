@eriklaes The poaching thing is a little strange. They're not really making a market for writing so much as making writers aware that there is a market for their writing. Substack makes a profit on their advances. Writers like Yglesias already could have made 6+ figures on their writing.

@eriklaes It feels all substack did is give the writers permission to ask for money and readers permission to pay? It's weird to put a buymeacoffee or patreon at the top of your medium or blogger but not weird to ask people to pay to subscribe to your substack.
