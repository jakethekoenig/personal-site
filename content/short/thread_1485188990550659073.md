Fitbit's sleep score is such bullshit. Tonight I had more REM and deep sleep and fewer major wakes than yesterday but because my time asleep went down my sleep score went down? How is that not a better sleep?

This is all Big Sleeps fault. They'd have me sleeping 24 hours a day if they had their way. Heckin Matt Walker and Arianna Huffington. I won't do it!
