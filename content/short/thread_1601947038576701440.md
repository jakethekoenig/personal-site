@xlr8harder I don't think FOOM as in, the AI looks at itself and improves it's architecture, is unrealistic. Maybe that it finds tons of low hanging fruit repeatedly is.

@xlr8harder Another FOOMish scenario is that once human lvl AI is economical to run, people will go from running a dozen instances to millions very quickly. I don't think it's unrealistic to think a million humans acting against everyone else's best interest could take control of the future

@xlr8harder Sort of an interesting vaguely related question: how many humans that could "perfectly" coordinate and trust each other would it take to take control of the US government?
