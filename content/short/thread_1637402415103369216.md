I guess the dream is you buy a big house to raise a family and then at retirement after all houses doubled, you move to a smaller house and make a lot of money? It's sort of a bad dream because in that scenario your children are much poorer than they could have been.

What would be good for me is if my house increased in value relative to everyone else's and I guess people implementing local policies towards that goal is why we have a global problem that's bad for everyone.
