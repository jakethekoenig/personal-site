Why was Moore's law exponential? My best explanation is: rate of improvement ∝ investment ∝ usefulness ∝ computer speed But it sort of predicts everything that can be improved will improve exponentially. Maybe true?

I guess part of my confusion is if there was so much room for consistent predictable improvement in 1970 why was there a "rate of improvement" at all. Why didn't they just predict what they'd be doing in 2010 and do it right a way?
