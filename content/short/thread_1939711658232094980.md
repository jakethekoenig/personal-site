In case it's not clear what you're looking at Mentat ran the Mentat backend and frontend server which I can see embedded in an iframe (the port 5173 tab). In that iframe I can see the diff of a "test pr" (Diff Viewer tab) it asked it's test bot to make to verify a feature.

What always held me back from using Mentat on mobile more is it was difficult to evaluate it's work without checking it out but now I can see it's interactions with a hot reloaded copy of it and I can see it's frontend changes live
