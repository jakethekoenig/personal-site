@pmarca Also it's one thing to say "selection effects CAN explain the large mortality drops among drinkers" quite another to show they DO. I have not seen a paper that does. I suspect because one does not exist because it is not true.

@pmarca In response to "sick people don't drink" and/or "people lie in self reports" consider this large N paper in which 1/day drinkers had better health outcomes than 0&lt;drinks&lt;1 drinkers: Suspicious!

@pmarca Of course if you personally feel better, that's all the reason you need to stop. But I feel better with 1 drink a day and I think the evidence is strong this is true for the median person
