2-1. And one of the wins was on time. I think I was right to first pick and build around Umori but with the new rules it feels fair. I should have put more of a premium on spell creatures while drafting.

This is my last draft before my one RCQ so wish my luck. My biggest take away from drafting is I will be 5c in sealed 100% of the time bc of the 3 good colorless fixers, dual lands and landcyclers together with infinite gold bombs

0-2 drop. Submitted a GW aggro-ish deck with elesh norn, yorion, imperiasaur, glistening dawn. Boarded into 5c yorion with bad mana for who knows what reason

Second MoM draft 3-0. I passed 3 hidetsugus. My sideboard is pretty deep so I'm not sure I built my 40 right. Astral Wingspan has felt very awkward.

First MoM draft 3-0. Thought after the draft I should have focused more on being convoke, dfc or 5c but borgy was too good for it to matter. Missed a funny lethal with complete the circuit + tandem takedown
