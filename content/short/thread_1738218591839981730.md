I'm so angry. When I plug my keyboard (usb) into my kvm switch and then plug it into my lenovo laptop (usb to usbc) it works. But if I use the exact same cables with my new mac it doesn't. (But it does work with a different usb to usbc wire). Computers were a mistake.

I "solved" the problem by getting out another usb to usb wire.
