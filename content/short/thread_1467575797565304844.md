## Tweet 1

I hate when an app that was quietly sitting on my phone doing what I wanted it to do when I needed it decides it's appropriate to send me notifications to remind me it exists and get me to use it.

Imagine if your vacuum asked if you wanted to clean or your fridge asked if you were hungry.

It's like how whenever you sign up for any service ever they decide it's appropriate to send you garbage emails until you explicitly tell them to stop.

Of course I know how to long press mute notifications and unsubscribe from emails but: 1. I shouldn't have to. These services should have some basic respect for me. 2. I weep for the boomers swimming in noise because they don't know how to do these things.
