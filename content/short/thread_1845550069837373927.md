Possibly dumb idea but has anyone ever tried to make an abstract syntax tree aware version control system?

Pros: have more powerful tools to visualize the evolution of the program Cons: can't support all languages. Projects want to put some files in VC that aren't code e.g. Readmes.

What I'm picturing is your VC instead of tracking the state of files tracks the state of the AST and diffs are tree modifications not line diffs.

One con is I guess you can't comment anymore unless you're preserving slightly more info than the AST
