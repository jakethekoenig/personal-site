I tried some weird ones in Hammer in a league but for some reason mtgo didn't change by deck when I dropped and re-entered a more traditional build for the 3 am PTQ. Still 6-2ed.

Zuran orb is great but burn is a good match up without it.

Kaldra was great in some spots but mostly bad.

3 am is the optimal start time for a PTQ. You can play the whole swiss and then your day is just beginning.
