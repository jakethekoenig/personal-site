@Teknium1 Hmm OpenAI has added the first feature and now supports sharing chats with images (which it didn't last I checked in August) so it isn't actually possible to have a big edge on them with these features anymore

@Teknium1 Wait actually they say you can't see the shared images (see screenshot text). And you can't in the chat when you click through. But you can! In the thumbnail. Seems like some kind of security oversight.
