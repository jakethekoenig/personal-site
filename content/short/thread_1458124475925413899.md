@grinberg_avi I think one of the primary benefits is people can send me eth at ja3k.eth instead of my full wallet public key. I think maybe in the future I may be able to use it as my identity to log on to other crypto apps. I'm not sure if that's likely/possible though.

@grinberg_avi ENS is a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) which means the holders of it's token control it. They just gave everyone who registered a .eth some amount of it depending on when you registered. For me this is worth ~$3-5k.

@grinberg_avi The tokens entitle me some control of the organization (which I will delegate). I think they might also entitle me to some of the fees the ENS collects (it costs eth to register a .eth). But I'm not sure.

@grinberg_avi I can also just sell them. My back of the envelope math suggests they should be worth ~$3 but are currently worth ~$30. But I don't really know anything. I'm also going to wait for gas to be cheaper to claim my tokens. I have until May.
