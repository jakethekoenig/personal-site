I think Carlsen really is about 80% to beat MVL and Grischuk and probably more than that to beat anyone else in the field. 50% seems a bit high but not much. I'd say 40%.

Not sure about Ledecky. She has the 400,800,1600 world records but they were set in 2016,2016 and 2018. Seems like the US almost always wins the freestyle relay so she only has to win 2. I'd say 65% is about right.

For basketball 75% seems right on base right. LeBron James isn't playing but I guess it's not unusual for the best American players to not play the Olympics.

I would have thought 60% was too high but if I'm understanding Djokovic's stats wikipedia page correctly he's won 70% of the tournaments he's played. Federer and Nadal won't be playing so I'd say this should probably be 80%.
