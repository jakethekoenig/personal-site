Ugh sort of think I need another keyboard. I really like my half + full but it takes more space on the desk than a split and I can't fix the xorg bug. Somehow splits are more expensive than half + full though?

Just one more keyboard. One more and I'll be able to work. Get some stuff done. Just one more.
