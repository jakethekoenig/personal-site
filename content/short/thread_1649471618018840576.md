This is my last draft before my one RCQ so wish my luck. My biggest take away from drafting is I will be 5c in sealed 100% of the time bc of the 3 good colorless fixers, dual lands and landcyclers together with infinite gold bombs

0-2 drop. Submitted a GW aggro-ish deck with elesh norn, yorion, imperiasaur, glistening dawn. Boarded into 5c yorion with bad mana for who knows what reason
