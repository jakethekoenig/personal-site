Picked up a loss against BG. Mulliganed 5 lands, Hagra Mauling and Journey to Oblivion. Should I keep that?

Beat RG stompy in a very close 3 game match. Boarded into UB for the first time. I thought the Glacial Grasps and Lullmage's Dominations would be well positioned.

Second loss to BW clerics. I boarded into UB again. Blood Beckoning + Tazen Roilmage is fun. The game didn't quite last long enough for that to decide it though. This is my third time in a row being the penultimate match to finish. This has been a really fast tournament.

Beat GW. 5-2 Now. Got scuted out game 2. My opponent had like 40 beetles.

Lost to an interesting mill deck round 8. 5-3 Now but I guess I might as well play the last one. I think I messed up by boarding into the UB deck this time. I was also choked on mana. I wonder if the UB deck I posted up top wants another 2 lands.

And I lost the last one to a good Mardu Party deck featuring Zagras. Ah well. Think I still probably min cash with 5-4. Glad the tournament went so fast. The format was a lot of fun. Especially in the first half of the day when I was winning.
