## Tweet 1

I remember reading a blog that said the modal (tech?) blog has three posts which are: 1. talking about how they're going to blog 2. talking about how the blog is hosted 3. apologizing for not writing more Does this sound familiar to anyone?

I thought @danluu might have said it but I didn't see any statements like this in his posts with writing/blogging in the title.
