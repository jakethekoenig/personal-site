@zswitten @eigenrobot I agree there's no stable algorithm we'd all agree optimizes for the most true/relevant results. But I don't think this implies that all approaches are equally good/fair. Or that it's unreasonable to call some approaches censorship.

@zswitten @eigenrobot Tbh I don't have much of an opinion on the object level. I think a reasonable person could see those bar graphs and think "Google is better for having less information" or "Google is acting as a censor by downranking things it dislikes".
