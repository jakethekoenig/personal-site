I'm not really anti-NFT and I'm certainly not anti-crypto. I just can't imagine looking at one of these apes and thinking "Yes, I'm glad I own this" let alone "Yes, I'm $100k+ glad I own this".

Oh shit it's all signaling. If you had an NFT of a beautiful piece of art people wouldn't know if you like NFTs or art. Only a true believer would own an ape.
