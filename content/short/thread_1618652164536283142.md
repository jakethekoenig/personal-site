Youtube just recommended me a video of an event in August 2015 with 8 views (it was posted this week for some reason). I was there. I remember this event. Does youtube's recommender system have access to my maps data?

Both in terms of social scene and content it is unusual that I was at this event. I was only in this city for one week and I never talked to the person who invited me after that summer. The camera never pans over the audience so I'm not in the footage.
