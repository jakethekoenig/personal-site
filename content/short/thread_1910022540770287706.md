If you think about it it's a little surprising phones aren't flown. Could save 2 weeks getting the phones to the stores. At that weight/volume it would add a ~$1 per phone. But a phone has a consumer value of at least $5/week of use.

I guess most phones aren't sold day of release so you'd be flying them in to sit in warehouses.
