Maybe there's some kind of cycle where people have some extraordinary early experiences, maybe while things were cheaper than sustainable and after a beat they realize their lives aren't greatly changed and their disillusioned?

Maybe people develop other non consumer more ideological reasons to dislike airbnb/amazon/llms and those reasons percolate into their perception of how great they are to use?
