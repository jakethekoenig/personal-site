I'm a dad! My daughter was born this November. Fairly premature, but she's doing really well and my wife and I hope to take her home this month!

Not sure exactly what our opsec policy is here but I guess I won't post her name, birthday or pictures. But know you're really missing out, she's the cutest baby ever.

It's been hard seeing her at the NICU so long but the nurses have all been really great and we've been really lucky to live just a 10m walk from the hospital so it's been easy to visit.
