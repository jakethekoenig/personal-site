@danluu I think emotions are just harder to talk about precisely. It's easy to write 10k words about vim even if switching to vim isn't going to solve your "real" problem which is you can't focus on work for more than a couple hours a week.

@danluu Thinking more about it I think I deny the premise. Seems like there's lots of writing about imposter syndrome, pomodoros, eating the frog, which is all sort of about your emotional relationship to work. Not sure these are useful mental constructs though.
