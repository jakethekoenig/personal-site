When I complain about taxes causing complicated paperwork people always derail by talking about automated W2 (equivalents) in other countries. But that's not really what I'm complaining about. It's the HSA/FSA/401k/roth monstrosity you have to optimize

Also I assume in these other countries you still have to figure out taxes for your hobby sources of income like gambling or tournaments or whatever. Which makes a lot of things that could otherwise be fun a lot less appealing.
