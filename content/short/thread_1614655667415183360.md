Holy shit, I just discovered that not only does my phone identify playing songs and display their info on my lock screen it also remembers every song it heard and when. Incredible!

Ha ha if you share your live location on gmaps it also shares your phone's battery level. "He's at 10% better find him fast"

For a concrete example: you can turn on location history in Google maps and get a cute little map of everywhere you go every day. I know exactly what I did on 9/8/2014 because of this feature. It even includes photos from Google photos. So cool. But you have to turn it on.

Wow, my phone has notification history. But again I have to turn it on instead of this obviously desirable feature being on by default
