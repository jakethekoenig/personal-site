The funny thing about "Google is a monopoly" discourse is they never really had a monopoly on search, at least not monopoly pricing power. They couldn't have even charged a penny and there were a lot of competitors that were 'fine'.

But they did have a monopoly on users and therefore a monopoly on search advertising space. Which means the cost of the space would be higher and the amount of advertising lower than if it was a competitive environment.

But almost anyone would agree this is in fact socially desirable!
