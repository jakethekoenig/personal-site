This reminds me of the time I read Colorless Tsukuru. I thought a girl had recommended it to me but when I tried to talk to her about it later she had no idea what I was talking about. When I asked the other person I thought might have suggested they were also confused.

So I have no idea why I read the book. It was fine but didn't make much of an impact.

Another time I read White Noise because it was in a girl's tinder bio. That book was great but she unmatched me when I tried to talk to her about it.
