Should have done it a long time ago. I actually solved issue #165 doing it (we're in the 3000s now). But the GitHub auth story around images is complicated. There's actually no way for an App to get an image from a private repo.

It's actually kind of insane. With a legacy pat you can curl an image as a user but with a finegrained pat even with all the permissions you can't.

So anyway I didn't solve that problem. It just works for public repos. Private repos can upload their images on the agent page.
