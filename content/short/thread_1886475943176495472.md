I might be too UBI brained but the state (of WA) should not offer paid parental leave benefits contingent on "Leave" or having a "Job". If they want to give people money for having kids they should just do it.

Though I guess there's a line item on my W2 that says WA - PFML so maybe there's a good reason it works this way which is that I'm paying for it.
