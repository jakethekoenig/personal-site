I just debugged a subtle bug in code I'm pretty sure I wrote with copilot and reading it carefully I realize it added a nice feature I wouldn't have thought to.

It's funny that copilot is very hesitant to put print statements in code even though it's really obvious it's what you want to do next. Probably because they're all stripped out of the training data (released code). Also I should learn to use a real debugger.
