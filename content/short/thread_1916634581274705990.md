It's weird that creatine became a mini current thing last week because I started supplementing about 1 month ago and feel like I've had a fair bit more energy and also have been hit less hard by sleep deprivation this new born period

I've wanted to supplement before but I've always wanted to do it post workout and haven't really worked out consistently since becoming a dad. But now I add it to my orange juice which I also started consistently drinking (possibly that's the cause of my new energy)
