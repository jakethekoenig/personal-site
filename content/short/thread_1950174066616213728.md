I keep hearing orgs want "subscriptions" for "predictable costs". How is this for a solution: api pricing but you can configure max spend per individual per unit time

Mentat is still api + 19.5% which to me is just how pricing should work. Though there should be good controls to see and limit spend. We have per agent controls but should probably have per user and per repo too.
