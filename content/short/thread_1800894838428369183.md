I don't get all the hate on gpt wrappers. It seems likely to me that value won't accumulate in the model layer. There's so much competition

The model takes in text and outputs text. There needs to be some kind of layer to get the model to do useful work. Maybe at present its difficult to get useful work out and shortly it'll be trivial. And model wrappers won't capture value either. But that's not obvious.

Perhaps the best model wrappers will turn out to be google .com and the iphone and startups are dead on arrival. But I don't think that's true. Apple makes a notes app and a vid chat app but there are still many very successful players there.
