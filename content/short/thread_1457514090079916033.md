@0x5a2fc8 Just finished season 1. Can't believe they ended with "Exit Music (for a film)". 20 years after Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet it's still the perfect song to end any film.

@0x5a2fc8 I don't think my wife appreciated it when I had to sing along to "motion picture soundtrack" when it played in Westworld.
