I once went on a tinder date with a girl who brought a bone saw. She said it was to cut off a pig's head for an art project.

She showed me pictures of the dead pig in her apartment but didn't invite me back to see it.

Oh yeah I almost forgot the weirdest part!! She thought in Scrabble if you bingoed on a double word tile you got a 100 point bonus instead of 50! I learned when she told me a word she opened with and the *incorrect* number of points it scored. What a psycho!!!!
