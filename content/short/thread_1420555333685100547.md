I think the problem isn't that people aren't incentived to change their minds but that in many contexts people aren't incentivized to be right at all.

I find in contexts like mtg deck building, math and gambling where there are clear rewards for being right people are very willing to change their minds when what they're doing isn't working.

In contexts like politics there's basically no reward for being right so why would you listen to peoples reasoned arguments and then change your mind if they seemed correct.
