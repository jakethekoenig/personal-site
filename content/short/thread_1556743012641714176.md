I gave him the mathematical formula to calculate the area of a rectangle. Rectangle Area = b*h where b,h are base and height. So, a 5x5 Kallax area = 25 block while a 4x2 Kallax area is 8 blocks. 2/3

The two 4x2 Kallax areas add up to 16. I said that even if he gave three Kallax, I would still lose-out. "How can you say you are giving me 3 extra blocks for free?" The owner was speechless. He finally gave me 4 Kallax. Take Maths seriously! 3/3
