## Tweet 1

I get all these spam messages that are group messages to ~20 people. Why do spammers do that? Why not message all 20 individually? Does it get around a chat creation rate limit or something?

## Tweet 2

This surprises me for 2 reasons: 1. Doesn't it make it 1000% obvious to the marks that the hot girl saying they need you isn't actually into you? 2. How is it not 1000% obvious to Twitter that an account DMing 30 other accounts with no connection isn't a spammer?

## Tweet 3

I love that Twitter puts the following in the same category: 1. A totally reasonable first message from a long term active tweeter who you happen to not follow/be followed by 2. A dm that says "I need you sexy" to 30 unrelated accounts
