@moultano @benthamite_ To me there's something off about the whole thing: VNM says we can assign real numbered functions to utility unique up to scale and shift. And now Harsayni is saying if we're rational we should add them?! What does it even mean to add a unitless number that can be shifted/scaledâ€¦
