Probably a horrible idea but it would be cool if jobs took an ISA from their employees to incentivize training (should be paired with a signing bonus to make it EV neutral)

Say you take a job which pays 100k and sign an agreement to give them 1% of your income over the next 10 years and they give you a $10k signing bonus. This is a wash if your income stays the same but now it's good for both of you if you switch jobs but make more money
