## Tweet 1

This surprises me for 2 reasons: 1. Doesn't it make it 1000% obvious to the marks that the hot girl saying they need you isn't actually into you? 2. How is it not 1000% obvious to Twitter that an account DMing 30 other accounts with no connection isn't a spammer?

## Tweet 2

I love that Twitter puts the following in the same category: 1. A totally reasonable first message from a long term active tweeter who you happen to not follow/be followed by 2. A dm that says "I need you sexy" to 30 unrelated accounts
