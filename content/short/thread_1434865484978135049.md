@MBCarr0 Abolish the FDA too: "It was the first time an F.D.A.-licensed vaccine was removed because of a concerted public-opinion campaign". "The F.D.A. found no suggestion that the Lyme vaccine caused harm to its recipients"

@MBCarr0 This FDA thing makes me so mad. Shouldn't one need to demonstrate actual harm to get a drug approval rescinded? Not just get a bunch of people angry? Why do we even have an FDA if they can rescind drug approval without 'finding a suggestion of harm'.
