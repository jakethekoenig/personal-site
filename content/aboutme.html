<p>Hi everyone! I have this website because it's <code class="inline">Current Year</code> and its about time I had an internet presence. I'm developing it myself instead of using a centralized service because I'd rather be uniquely bad than nondescriptly good.</p>
<p>My goal for the site is for it to be a fun place with weird things of unclear purpose. At the moment I have an experiments page with javascript toys and a blog page with things I've written. I don't know how frequently I will update it or add to it in the future. </p>
<p> Want to contact me for any reason? You can e-mail me at <a href="mailto:jake@ja3k.com">jake@ja3k.com</a>. Actually at the moment you can message me at any e-mail on this domain. The legacy means of contacting me by messaging me on <a href=https://www.chess.com target="_blank">chess.com</a> where my username is my domain is still effective. If anything I'll probably be more responsive there because I'll see your message when I log on to do my daily puzzles.</p>
