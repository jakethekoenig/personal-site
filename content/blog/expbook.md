I've always wanted to write a children's book about some mathematical topic and exponential growth struck me as something that both has intuitive mechanisms, arises in real world situations and has easy to illustrate geometric implications. I hope you enjoy Exponential Growth for Babies, available for purchase on [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Exponential-Growth-Babies-Jake-Koenig/dp/B0BMJQ8X5L/).
