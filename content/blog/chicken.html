<p>It's commonly claimed that eating chicken is less ethical than eating beef [[The proximate cause for me writing this piece is this <a href='https://www.worksinprogress.co/issue/practical-veganism/' target='_blank'>article</a> which came to me by this <a href='https://twitter.com/peterwildeford/status/1521198328918200326?s=20&t=YzAXqe1Q5jrmH2C_Ii6Vkw' target='_blank'>tweet</a>. But I've heard it from friends before.]]. The core piece of evidence for this claim is true and relevant: A chicken is a big meal but a cow is hundreds of meals. But I think proponents underrate a countervailing force: a single chicken is likely far less morally significant than a single cow. It's harder to quantify and be certain about this difference but I think it's likely real and large. Proponents seem to take it as plausible that a chicken and cow are equally morally important. See this <a href='https://www.worksinprogress.co/issue/practical-veganism/' target='_blank'>article</a> which makes that assumption or this <a href='https://reducing-suffering.org/how-much-direct-suffering-is-caused-by-various-animal-foods/' target='_blank'>page</a> which gives the default estimate of a chicken's sentience as half that of a cow's.</p>

<p>But why should we assume a chicken life is roughly equal to that of a cows? If a cow is hundreds of times larger than a chicken is it unreasonable to think it might be hundreds of times more morally significant? A chicken's brain is about 3 grams [[ <a href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579120302133' target='_blank'>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579120302133</a> Interestingly this is small for a bird of it's size. Raven's have <a href='https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1517131113#sfig05' target='_blank'>14 gram</a> brains and smaller bodies. This could be due to domestication. Here's a <a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7615926/' target='_blank'>paper</a> which shows domesticated turkeys have smaller brains than their wild counterparts.]] whereas a cow has a brain size of 480g [[ <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4851379/' target='_blank'>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4851379/</a>]]. Because of this my null hypothesis on how much more morally significant a cow is to a chicken is 150x and that is my sentience multiplier in calculations. </p>

<p>I'm not saying this is definitely the truth. I'm not an expert in pain, brain structures or evolutionary history. There are a lot of factors to consider. But I don't know why you'd start from a position that individuals should be equally morally important? I think it's a fine approximation when talking about humans especially since humans have a preference for fair policies anyway. But it seems absurd when talking about such radically different organisms.</p> 
<p>If you take the estimates of the other factors given by <a href='https://reducing-suffering.org/how-much-direct-suffering-is-caused-by-various-animal-foods/' target='_blank'>reducing suffering</a> seriously, which includes that cows live in captivity ~10 times longer and chickens have a worse time in their coops and just give chickens a sentience multiplier of 0.01 you get the conclusion that a kilogram of chicken causes less than half as much suffering as a kilogram of beef. At the moment that's my best guess.</p>
