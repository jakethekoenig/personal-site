A common narrative is that we live in an age of dwindling privacy. And there is a narrow sense in which this is true: all your webpage visits, clicks and scrolls are likely logged in some database and used for all kinds of hard to understand purposes. But actually we live in an age of unprecedented privacy. For the most part no one knows how anyone spends their time on the internet. The *services* know. They literally have to. But no one knows what the people around them are consuming.

Think about how strange this present interaction we're having is: you're reading this text, my intimate thoughts, and yet your identity is utterly private to me. How strange is it that the number of people who view a tweet is >10x the number of people who like it? Once upon a time before the written word the only way for me to tell you something would have been face to face. You know my identity, I know yours. Now it takes little effort to publish anonymously and by default you don't know who your readers are.

This stuff isn't new just a continuation of ancient trends
- The oldest written artifacts are 7000 years old
- The federalist papers were published under psuedonyms

The written word or otherwise prerecorded media has become the default mode of conversation. Trends on the amount of time people spend with friends and coworkers are shocking. By far the most important facts of our age.

Even very recently it would have been difficult to produce an artifact like this blog. 

Why is the online privacy meme so sticky?
There are two reasons:
1. For the most part people are deeply embarrassed by how they spend their time online.
2. As things become safer/better people become more sensitive to infractions that would previously have been unnoticed.


I think this pattern
