It's commonly believed that the world is less important if it's a simulation. The arguments are clear:

- Waste matters less if you have a spare.
- If we're not the center of the universe the universe is not about us.

But consider this: the appearance of the I block in tetris is so much more important for the emotional reaction of the player. When the game ends the activity in the game is no longer relevant to the game pieces. But the game lives on in what the player learned and felt. The score may have great importance for a tournament.

Analogously we should assume if there is something outside that created us that our actions are far more important than we imagine because they will echo on at a scale we cannot perceive or even comprehend. Unfortunately we cannot know at all what that impact is. I'm not here to give you an actionable moral philosophy. All the best ones are hopelessly intractable anyway.
