Booster effectiveness dropped from 70% to at most 40% but by my estimate 6-22% in omicron world. While hospitalization rate fell to a third. So boosting became somewhere from 1/5 to 1/60th as valuable.\n2. Getting covid for them probably means missing 1 to 2 games which from what I understand is quite costly.\n3. They&#039;re public figures who aren&#039;t going to get any respect for being contrarian, even if they&#039;re right.\n\nI&#039;m also not sure how they make these decisions. Do too athletes have a team of doctors? I&#039;d guess there decision making process isn&#039;t actually that good even though the stakes are high. I could be wrong though.",
